# Sandbox Tools Plugin - TODO

> **Navigation**: [Main README](../README.md) | [Plugin README](../README.md#tools) | [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Status Summary

**Current State**: Reference implementation - feature merged into Eclipse JDT

### Completed
- ✅ While-to-For loop conversion implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ **Successfully contributed to Eclipse JDT**
- ✅ Code merged into Eclipse JDT core

### In Progress
- None (active development is in Eclipse JDT repository)

### Pending
- Periodic sync with Eclipse JDT version to ensure consistency

## Module Purpose

This module serves as a **reference implementation** demonstrating successful contribution to Eclipse JDT. It is **not actively developed** since the feature now exists in Eclipse JDT.

## Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Periodic Sync Verification
**Priority**: Low  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours annually

Periodically verify that sandbox version remains consistent with Eclipse JDT version:
- Compare implementation with Eclipse JDT code
- Verify tests still pass
- Update documentation if Eclipse version diverges
- Note any improvements made in Eclipse that could apply elsewhere

**Benefits**:
- Ensure reference implementation stays accurate
- Learn from Eclipse maintainer improvements
- Identify patterns for other sandbox cleanups

### 2. Documentation Updates
**Priority**: Low  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours as needed

Update documentation to reflect:
- Links to Eclipse JDT implementation
- Eclipse release version containing the feature
- Any changes made during Eclipse review process
- Community feedback on the feature

## No Active Development

**Important**: This module is a reference implementation, not an active project. New features and bug fixes should be contributed directly to Eclipse JDT, not developed here.

## Value as Reference

### For New Contributors
This module provides:
- Example of contribution-ready code structure
- Reference for test coverage standards
- Template for Eclipse JDT cleanups
- Demonstration of successful contribution workflow

### For Sandbox Development
This module demonstrates:
- Quality standards Eclipse expects
- How to structure Eclipse plugin code
- Comprehensive testing approach
- Documentation requirements

## Eclipse JDT Version

The feature exists in Eclipse JDT as part of the Java cleanup framework. Users should use the Eclipse JDT version, not this sandbox version.

### Where to Find It
- **Eclipse JDT UI**: Part of Java cleanup preferences
- **Source**: Eclipse JDT UI repository
- **Documentation**: Eclipse JDT documentation

## Historical Reference

### Development History
1. Initial implementation in sandbox
2. Iterative testing and refinement
3. Code review preparation
4. Submission to Eclipse Gerrit
5. Review and revision based on feedback
6. Acceptance and merge into Eclipse JDT

### Key Success Factors
- Comprehensive test coverage from the start
- Following Eclipse code conventions
- Clear documentation
- Responsive to reviewer feedback
- Well-defined scope and purpose

## Future Contributions

### Using This as Template
When developing new cleanups for Eclipse contribution:
1. Study this module's structure
2. Follow similar testing patterns
3. Match code organization
4. Maintain similar documentation
5. Use as quality benchmark

### Contribution Checklist
Based on this successful contribution:
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- [ ] Follow Eclipse code conventions
- [ ] Clear, focused scope
- [ ] Well-documented architecture
- [ ] No external dependencies
- [ ] Compatible with Eclipse license (EPL 2.0)
- [ ] Responsive to community feedback

## Known Issues

None - module is stable and feature is in Eclipse JDT.

## Lessons for Future Contributions

### What Worked Well
1. Developing in sandbox environment first
2. Comprehensive testing before submission
3. Following Eclipse conventions from start
4. Clear, focused feature scope
5. Good documentation

### Recommendations
1. Start with sandbox experimentation
2. Build comprehensive tests early
3. Study existing Eclipse code
4. Engage with Eclipse community early
5. Be responsive to feedback
6. Keep scope focused and manageable

## Archive Status

This module is effectively **archived** as a reference. It demonstrates:
- ✅ A successful sandbox → Eclipse workflow
- ✅ Quality standards for Eclipse contribution
- ✅ Comprehensive testing approach
- ✅ Proper documentation practices

Use it as a **template and reference** for future Eclipse JDT contributions.
