description=Detects shift operations where the shift amount is out of range and replaces\n\
the shift amount with the effective masked value. In Java, shift amounts are masked:\n\
for int types with 0x1f (31) and for long types with 0x3f (63). This cleanup makes\n\
the actual Java behavior explicit by replacing out-of-range constants.
