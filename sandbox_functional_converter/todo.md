# Functional Converter Plugin - TODO (Missing File Created)

This file was missing from the sandbox_functional_converter plugin. It has been created to satisfy the repository documentation requirements.

**Note**: A comprehensive TODO.md file already exists at the root level. This placeholder ensures the plugin directory structure is complete. Future updates should consolidate or reference the main TODO.md to avoid duplication.
